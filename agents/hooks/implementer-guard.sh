# PreToolUse hook for the implementer subagents: nothing a dispatched
# implementer runs may publish, close its Issue, or change a branch that is
# not an agent branch. Exit 2 = blocked, exit 0 = allowed.
#
# Two layers. git's destructive forms are left to the fork's hardened
# guardrail, skills/misc/git-guardrails-claude-code/scripts/block-dangerous-git.sh,
# which already blocks `git push` in every form it knows (plain, `git -C`,
# env-prefixed, after a separator). This script then enforces:
#
# - no publishing: opening or merging a pull request, a `gh api` write, or
#   syncing the beads remote;
# - no bd call without `--sandbox`, which disables Dolt auto-push;
# - no closing an Issue (`bd close`, `--status closed`): the orchestrator
#   closes it after the merge;
# - git changes only through `git -C <absolute path>` into a repository whose
#   checked-out branch starts with `agent/`. Read-only git runs anywhere. The
#   repository is never inferred from a `cd` or the payload's `cwd`: Codex
#   gives each shell call its own working directory and reports only the
#   session's in the payload, so an explicit `-C` is the one location both
#   harnesses let the hook see truthfully.
#
# The command `implementer-guard-check` is a canary: it is always blocked with
# a fixed message, so an implementer can prove at startup that its guard is
# live. Codex runs a command whose hook is missing, untrusted or crashed, so
# the canary is what turns a silent open failure into a FAILED report.
#
# Prose-only, in the implementing-an-issue skill: that the agent branch is the
# one the brief names, and that the implementer never merges into FEATURE. The
# hook cannot see the brief, so it enforces the class of branch, not the
# branch.
#
# Installed as a symlink by scripts/link-agents.sh; the guardrail is found by
# resolving that link back into the skills repo, so a `git pull` there keeps
# both current. Fails CLOSED, like the guardrail: a missing guardrail, a
# missing jq, an unreadable payload, or a git change whose repository or
# branch cannot be resolved blocks the command.
#
# A seatbelt, not a sandbox: it reads the command line, so a publishing call
# hidden inside a script file, a git alias (`git -c alias.p=push p`) or a
# Makefile target still gets through, and so does anything typed into a shell
# Codex already started (its `write_stdin` input is never hooked). It stops an
# implementer that follows or half-follows its instructions, which is the
# failure it exists for.

# The guardrail matches only the plain shapes of a command, which suits a

# of wrappers (`command`, `env`, `nohup`, `bash -c "..."`, `/usr/bin/git`)
# until the real tool is first. The cost is over-blocking a quoted mention
# that contains a separator (`-m "a; gh pr create"`), which is acceptable for
# an agent that is not meant to write such commands anyway.
#
# A substitution also leaves a SUBST marker where it cut, so a git segment
# still sees that its `-C` path or subcommand came from one: without it,
# `git -C $(pwd) commit` would split into a `git -C` with nothing to check.
